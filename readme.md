# Python Course

Hi! Jorge Here. Welcome to Python_course repo. This are all the exercises We have made during the course "Gestion de la Información en la web", where my team and I got 9.38 as final mark (well done guys!).

This repo merge and organise better all the work we have done during these four months from these 2 repositories:

- Python NoSQL & Security <a href="https://github.com/ferreiro/Python-NoSQL-Security" target="_blank">(See repo)</a>
- Python Introduction & SQL <a href="https://github.com/ferreiro/Python-Introduction-SQL" target="_blank">(See repo)</a>

### Team and Credits:
- Jorge Ferreiro (Backend / SQL / NOSQL Database / Security / Frontend).
- Tommaso Innocenti (Backend / SQL / NOSQL Database / Security).

We also want to thanks Luis Felipe de Oliveira for some of his contributions as well as the 'TweetsFilter' exercise that he made.

### Use instructions and extra information
#### Python Version
All the code is made using python 2.7. For some programs you may need to install additional frameworks such as Bottle, Sha256... For each project you can read the extra modules you need to install in the header of the main .py files.

#### How to Run?
1. To run a program, open a Terminal (MAC/Linux) or cmd windowand.
2. Go to the path of the project you want to execute using cd "YOUR_PATH".
3. Type $ python *NameOfTheMainFile*.py

#### Variety.js
In some programs we use this .js script we found on github to get the implicit schema of a collection of JSON objects.
